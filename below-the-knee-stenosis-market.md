<p><p>Below-the-knee stenosis refers to the narrowing of the blood vessels below the knee, often leading to reduced blood flow to the lower extremities. This condition can cause pain, weakness, and complications like limb ischemia. As the population ages and lifestyles become more sedentary, the prevalence of below-the-knee stenosis is increasing, driving demand for effective treatment options.</p><p>The Below-The-Knee Stenosis Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.3% during the forecast period. This growth is attributed to advancements in minimally invasive surgical techniques, increased awareness of vascular health, and a rise in the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Technological innovations in diagnostics and treatment, including the use of drug-eluting balloons and stents, are also contributing to market expansion.</p><p>Key trends indicate a growing emphasis on personalized medicine, where treatment is tailored to individual patient profiles. Additionally, the integration of telemedicine platforms for pre- and post-operative care is enhancing patient engagement and outcomes. Collaborations between healthcare providers and technology companies are expected to further accelerate innovations in this field, positioning the below-the-knee stenosis market for robust growth in the coming years.</p></p>
