<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Blacks for Rubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Black</li><li>Furnace Black</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon blacks are vital reinforcing agents in rubber production, enhancing strength and durability. The market primarily consists of two types: thermal black and furnace black. Thermal black is produced through the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, resulting in larger particle sizes and lower reinforcement properties. In contrast, furnace black is created via the combustion of hydrocarbons in a controlled environment, yielding finer particles that provide superior reinforcing characteristics, making it more popular for high-performance applications in tires and industrial rubber goods.</p></p>
