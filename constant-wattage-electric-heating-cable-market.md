<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Constant Wattage Electric Heating Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Parallel Electric Heating Cable</li><li>Series Electric Heating Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The constant wattage electric heating cable market comprises two main types: parallel electric heating cables and series electric heating cables. Parallel electric heating cables distribute electrical current evenly along their length, providing consistent heating and allowing for sections of the cable to be cut without affecting performance. In contrast, series electric heating cables connect end-to-end, causing each segment to share the load, which can result in temperature variations. Both types are used for freeze protection, process heating, and comfort heating applications.</p></p>
