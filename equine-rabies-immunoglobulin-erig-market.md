<p><strong>The Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG) Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Category II Exposure</li><li>Category III Exposure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG) is crucial for post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies in individuals with potential exposures. In Category II exposure, where there is a bite or scratch from an animal without rabies symptoms, ERIG may not be routinely required but is recommended in some cases. In Category III exposure, involving significant bites or exposure from rabid animals, ERIG is essential alongside rabies vaccination to provide immediate passive immunity, thereby mitigating the risk of rabies infection.</p></p>
