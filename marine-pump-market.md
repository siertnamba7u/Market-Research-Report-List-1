<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li><li>Roto-Dynamic Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine pump market comprises primarily two types: positive displacement pumps and roto-dynamic pumps. Positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed volume of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, making them ideal for high-viscosity fluids and precise flow control. In contrast, roto-dynamic pumps rely on rotational energy to move fluid, offering a continuous flow suitable for low-viscosity applications. Both types are crucial for various marine operations, including ballast management, fuel transfer, and cooling systems.</p></p>
