<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Relief Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reclosing Pressure Relief System</li><li>Nonreclosing Pressure Relief System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pressure Relief Systems market is divided into two main types: Reclosing and Nonreclosing Pressure Relief Systems. Reclosing systems automatically reset after relieving pressure, making them suitable for applications where pressure fluctuations occur but eventual stabilization is expected. In contrast, Nonreclosing systems remain open after activation, providing a one-time relief option, ideal for critical scenarios where overpressure can lead to catastrophic failures. Both types ensure safety and operational efficiency in various industrial processes and equipment management.</p></p>
